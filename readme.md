# UsefulScripts
A collection of various scripts that I wrote for various purposes.
It has scripts to the following tasks:

## Descriptions of each script
* Initialize a C++ project with a makefile and a skeleton main 
  function - `quick-cpp-setup.sh`
* A script that is equalivalent to the autoversion plug-in for
  code blocks and works with gnu make. It creates a version.h file
  and talks to your git repo `autoversion.h`

## Notes
* scripts under `inprogress` are not done yet and should not be used
  unless you are feeling adventurous.
