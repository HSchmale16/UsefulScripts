# UsefulScripts
(c) 2015 Henry J Schmale

A collection of various scripts that I wrote for various purposes.
Some of them assist with development, and others help automate
boring tasks.

Each directory has scripts written for working on various different
types of projects. The directory name should be self-explanatory, if
it is not there might be a read-me in that directory to help out
with understanding the scripts in that directory.

Scripts that exist in the project root directory are good general
purpose scripts that don't fit into the other directories.
