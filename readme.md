# UsefulScripts
(c) 2015 Henry J Schmale

A collection of various scripts that I wrote for various purposes.
It has scripts to the following tasks:

## Descriptions of each script
* Initialize a C++ project with a makefile and a skeleton main 
  function - `quick-cpp-setup.sh`.
* A script that is equalivalent to the autoversion plug-in for
  code blocks and works with gnu make. It creates a version.h file
  and talks to your git repo. It needs to be copied
  into your project directory for use, and called by your build system
  before starting your build. `autoversion.h`
* C++ class creation script, which prepares the skeleton of a class and
  a skeleton implementation of it, putting the declaration and implementation
  in seperate files. `makelass.pl`
