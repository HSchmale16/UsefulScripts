# UsefulScripts
(c) 2015 Henry J Schmale

A collection of various scripts that I wrote for various purposes.
Some of them assist with development, and others help automate
boring tasks.

Each directory has scripts written for working on various differint
types of projects. The directory name should be self-explantory, if
it is not there might be a read-me in that directory to help out
with understanding the scripts in that directory.

Scripts that exist in the project root directory are good general
purpose scripts that don't fit into the other directories.

# License
You (from this point on referred to as The You) are hereby 
granted by me (from this point on referred to as The Me) 
license to knock yourself silly with this template. 
By using this template The You implicitly accepts this 
license and pledges solemnly to never claim creative 
ownership of any graphics, code, concepts, eggs, bacon, ideas, 
colors, shapes, hypertext-transfer protocols or other conduits 
of the visual splendor thatis this template. 

The Me, in turn, pledges equally solemnly to be far too 
lazy to ever check up on you, so if you do manage to pull 
some chicks The Me won't have a cow. 
However The Me would be sorely disappointed if The You 
were to try and sell or distribute this work without 
acknowledging The Me. Seriously. The Me will come down on 
The You like a large quantitiy of hard and heavy objects 
that in large quantities may be harmful and possibly even 
lethal to The You; So don't even think about it, The Buster.
