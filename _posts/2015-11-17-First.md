This is the first post for the blog of my useful scripts. This is a
collection of various scripts that I have written and use for various
tasks. I will also throw any other random script that I write into this
repository as this is my random stuff repository.

This scripts were written as attempts to learn a language or do some task.
So don't expect too much from them.

This website was created mostly as an attempt to learn how to use github
pages. So, this site will be about how the scripts, and documentation on
how to use them.
