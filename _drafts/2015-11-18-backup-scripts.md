title: The Backup Scripts
author: Henry J Schmale
---

This repository includes a couple of scripts to perform backups of a
folder or git repository. These scripts are included in the `/backup`
directory of the repository. All of these scripts require the [gdrive][1]
program to upload to Google drive. Google drive was chosen, because it is
free.
